          Valeria works full-time as an underwater welder off the coast of Valencia, Spain. She is also one of the many blue-collar cyborg workers who maintain the extensive array of underwater power grids.
        </p>
        <p class="josefin hot-fushia">
          Naturally, that means she makes plentiful use of her wadestone attachments. Wadestone is a man-made alloy made using bizmuth and a common off-planet metal. Valeria can manipulate them using the same electrical impulses she uses to move her prosthetic arms or blink her artificial eyes. Yes, even her three-pupiled eye is a prosthetic. In the future, on Earth, it’s common for  people to get replacement parts that fit whatever mutations they were born with.

          Jellyfish are essential to a specific kind of renewable energy, and cyborgs are the best equipped to help make the most out of it, since they have better protection against their stings. The wadestone appendages are the middleman between them.
        </p>
        <p class="josefin hot-lilac">
          The alien metal compound sticks to plankton, jellyfishes' main source of food, and when the jellies come to feed on the buildups on the wadestone, the metal "charges up" with energy. The metal reacts to the jellies' stinging cells, or cnidocytes, and this chemical reaction can be harvested and used to destroy oceanic pollution en masse or to create cleaner energy than fossil fuels.
        </p>
        <p class="josefin spicy-mint">
          Though Jellyfish and mutant jellies are more plentiful now after climate change, they are negatively affected by pollution just like humans are. Living in underwater cities alongside humans has been beneficial for them as because of how consistently clean these places are of pollution. Humans certainly don't mind, seeing as they are seeking to someday be able to satisfy their energy needs exclusively through jellyfish power. Given how easy it is becoming and how ubiquitous wadestone is now, this is closer and closer to becoming a reality.
        </p>
        <p class="josefin hot-lilac">
          The major drawback to it is that it usually takes a long time to collect cnidocytes from jellies. Certain groups, such as the sea slug mutants who live in much closer tandem with sea creatures than other humans, take issue with humans breeding jellyfish and having them as pets, feeling like the relationship is often more exploitative than collaboratory.
